Py-city schools written report


I was able to conduct some analysis in order to help the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. Using data from fifteen different schools I used pandas to gather math and reading scores, school sizes, school types, and average passing percentages and much more. I created new Dataframes using the data given and found to see if spending budgets made a difference in scores and passing rates. I found that on average math and reading scores remained consistant when grouped by school. However, when it came to school types  Charter schools had an higher overall passing rate vs District schools. Based on calculations I was able to conclude that the lowest spending range per sudent had a higher overall passing percentage.
